## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Off-white (#F0F0F0), almost desaturated from light-grey, for a background reminiscent of the grey gradients common in photography and cinema. It will function best in Dark Mode. As requested, use Black (#000000) as text.
- Background color: Almost black background (#121212) to emphasize the vibrant product can on-screen.
- Accent color: Vibrant grape (#A758B8). A deep saturated purple serves as a visual suggestion of grape, a component of the client's flavor line.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for body and headline.
- Minimal, monochrome social icons in the footer.
- Full-screen hero section with background WebP sequence and overlay text.
- Clean, consistent layout for standard sections: Product, Ingredients, Nutrition, Reviews, FAQ, Contact.
- Parallax scroll behavior that maps scroll position to the WebP sequence frame index.
